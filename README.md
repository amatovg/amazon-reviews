Analysis with Hadoop of 35 Million Reviews for a Semester Project at EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne)

One part of the project was to analyse the available dataset and see correlations between a variety of statistics

The other part of the project was designing a method to find for a given project its competing products, based on the difference between scores that reviewers gave to both products. For this we mapped the reviews into nodes of a graph with the edges representing the amount of reviewers who rated one review (much) higher than the other.
